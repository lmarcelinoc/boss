Sessions are properly created, stored, validated, and cleaned up. Includes device fingerprinting, IP tracking, and comprehensive session audit trail. All session endpoints (create, validate, revoke, logout-all) tested and operational.

•	[x] **Auth Guards & Decorators**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Created comprehensive reusable NestJS guards and decorators for authentication and authorization. Implemented EnhancedAuthGuard combining JWT validation, role-based access control, permission checks, MFA enforcement, and tenant isolation. Added 15+ decorators including @OwnerOnly(), @AdminOnly(), @RequireMfa(), @SensitiveOperation(), @HighPrivilegeOperation(), and user extraction decorators (@CurrentUser, @UserId, @UserRoles, etc.). All guards properly integrated and exported for application-wide use.

### **✅ Recently Completed Security Implementation:**
•	[x] **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented comprehensive hierarchical roles (Super Admin, Owner, Admin, Manager, Member, Viewer) with associated permissions. Each authenticated user has a role per tenant with proper API access restrictions. Created RoleService, PermissionService, and RoleHierarchyService with full RBAC management and automatic role seeding.

•	[x] **Permission Checks**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented resource-level permission guards in NestJS with fine-grained access control (read vs write permissions). Created custom decorators (@RequirePermissions, @Roles) and guards (PermissionsGuard, EnhancedRolesGuard) to check permissions on protected routes with comprehensive permission enforcement.

•	[x] **Tenant Isolation Security**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Enforced multi-tenant data isolation at all levels. All database queries are automatically scoped by tenantId via Prisma middleware, implemented PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) for critical tables, and created TenantIsolationService with TenantContextService for proper tenant context management.

•	[x] **API Rate Limiting**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented comprehensive global rate limiting with Redis-based distributed rate limiting. Created RateLimitingService with customizable rate limit decorators (@StrictRateLimit, @AuthRateLimit, @BulkOperationRateLimit, etc.) and RateLimitGuard for distributed rate limit enforcement across multiple servers.

•	[x] **Security Headers & CORS**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Configured comprehensive global HTTP security headers (Content-Security-Policy, XSS-Protection, HSTS, Frame-Options, etc.) and CORS policy. Created SecurityAuditService for security configuration analysis and SecurityMonitoringMiddleware for real-time threat detection with proper origin validation and secure cookie handling.

•	[x] **Audit Logging**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented comprehensive auditing of security events including logins, logouts, failed login attempts, password changes, 2FA setup, role changes, permission modifications, and suspicious activities. Created EnhancedAuditService with security monitoring integration, AuditAdminController for admin panel review, and comprehensive audit trail functionality with real-time security event correlation.

## 3. 🎨 Frontend UI Tasks

### **✅ Completed Features:**
•	[x] **Registration Page**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Built responsive sign-up form with comprehensive validation (name, email, password confirmation, organization name, terms acceptance). Includes client-side validation for password strength, required fields, email format, and password matching. Integrated with backend registration API with proper error handling and success feedback. Implements deferred tenant creation pattern per PRD requirements.

•	[x] **Login Page**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented responsive login form for existing users with email & password authentication. Added proper error handling for invalid credentials, unverified email, and network issues. Integrated JWT token storage and auth state management via React Context. Includes progressive MFA flow that automatically transitions to 2FA verification when required, with "Remember me" functionality and social auth placeholder.

•	[x] **2FA Verification UI**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented seamless 2FA verification flow integrated within the login process. When MFA is required, form transitions to show 6-digit TOTP code input with clear instructions. Includes proper validation, error handling, and "Back to password" navigation. UI supports both TOTP codes and backup codes (10-character backup codes automatically detected). Professional loading states and success feedback throughout the flow.

### **🔄 Pending Implementation:**
•	[ ] **Forgot Password Flow**: Create a "Forgot Password" page where users can request a password reset. This will capture their email and call the API to send a reset link. After the email is sent, inform the user to check their inbox. Also create a "Reset Password" page that the email link will navigate to, containing a form to enter a new password (and confirm it). On submission, call the reset API to update the password and then redirect the user to login.

•	[ ] **Account Security Settings UI**: In the user account area (or profile page), provide UI for security settings. This includes the ability to enable/disable two-factor authentication (with appropriate flow to scan QR code and verify code when enabling), view or regenerate backup codes, and see active sessions/devices. For session management, list the user's active sessions (device or location info if available) and allow them to log out other sessions.

---

## 4. 🧪 Testing & Documentation Tasks

### **Authentication Testing:**
•	[ ] **Auth Module Testing**: Develop unit tests for all authentication logic – covering registration (valid and invalid inputs), login (correct vs incorrect password), token generation, and 2FA verification. Include tests for edge cases like token expiration and reuse.

•	[ ] **Integration Tests (Auth)**: Write integration tests to simulate full auth flows. For example, a test that registers a new user, verifies their email (perhaps by simulating the verification token usage), then logs in with correct credentials and gets an authenticated response. Test the refresh token cycle (ensure a new access token is granted and the old refresh token is invalidated).

•	[ ] **Security Testing**: Perform brute-force protection tests (e.g., simulate many failed logins to ensure rate limiting kicks in) and ensure locked-out behavior or captchas as appropriate. Test that protected endpoints return 401/403 when no token or an invalid token is provided.

### **Documentation:**
•	[ ] **API Documentation (Auth)**: Document all auth endpoints in the OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation – including register, login, logout (if applicable), refresh, 2FA enable/verify, password reset. Provide request/response examples and error cases.

•	[ ] **Postman Collection**: Update or create a Postman collection that covers the authentication APIs (registration, login, refresh, etc.) for developers to easily test these flows.

•	[ ] **Developer Guide (Auth)**: In the project docs, include a section explaining the authentication flow and security measures (password hashing, JWT, 2FA, etc.). Also, include instructions on initial setup (for example, how to create the first admin user or default credentials for testing).

---

## 5. 👤 User Profile & Account Management

### **Backend API Tasks:**
•	[ ] **Profile CRUD Endpoints**: Implement an endpoint to fetch the current user's profile data and an endpoint to update their profile. Profile data includes fields like name, display name, avatar URL, contact info, timezone, etc.. Apply input validation (e.g., valid email format if changing email, allowable file types for avatar).

•	[ ] **Avatar Upload Integration**: Integrate with the file storage service to allow users to upload a profile picture. This could use a dedicated endpoint that issues a pre-signed upload URL (or you can reuse a general file upload API) and then update the user's profile with the avatar URL. Validate avatar image dimensions/size and file type.

•	[ ] **Profile Update Security**: Ensure that profile update actions require authentication and only allow a user to update their own profile. If email change is allowed, handle it carefully (possibly require re-verification of the new email).

•	[ ] **Password Change Endpoint**: Provide an authenticated endpoint for users to change their password. The endpoint should require the current password for confirmation, and then allow setting a new password (with strength validation). On success, invalidate old sessions/tokens as needed so the password change is effective immediately.

•	[ ] **User Account States**: Implement support for user account states and enforce them in auth logic. For example, if a user is "pending" (email not verified) or "suspended", the login endpoint should reject access. Provide backend logic for an admin to change a user's state (e.g., suspend or reactivate a user) – this might tie into the Admin module.

•	[ ] **Notification Preferences Model**: (If not covered in notifications module) ensure there's a place in the profile or user settings to store notification preferences (e.g., in a separate table or JSON field per user). This might include email vs SMS preferences, which will be managed via the Notifications module but stored per user.

### **Frontend UI Tasks:**
•	[ ] **Profile Page UI**: Create a user profile page in the application where the user can view and edit their account information. This page should display the user's current profile details and provide an edit form for fields like name, display name, phone, etc. Only allow editing of permissible fields.

•	[ ] **Avatar Upload Component**: On the profile page, include the ability to upload or change the profile picture. This should show the current avatar (or a default avatar) and allow the user to select a new image. Implement client-side validation for image file type/size and preview the image before upload. On submission, use the backend's upload mechanism to update the avatar and refresh the displayed image.

•	[ ] **Account Settings (Profile)**: Include UI for other account management tasks: for example, a section to change the password (with fields for current password, new password, confirm new password). Also, if relevant, a section to manage personal preferences like time zone or language. Provide appropriate success/error feedback for these actions (e.g., "Password changed successfully").

•	[ ] **Security Settings UI**: Within the account settings or profile, integrate security-related controls. For instance, show whether two-factor auth is enabled and allow the user to disable/enable it (this might link to the Auth module's UI flows). Display the list of active sessions/devices (if available) and allow the user to log out other sessions (e.g., a "Log out of other devices" button that calls the appropriate API).

•	[ ] **Email Verification UX**: If the user's email is not verified (pending state), display a notice on the profile or dashboard prompting them to verify their email. Provide a button to resend verification email if needed. Once they verify (perhaps via a link that brings them back to a verified state), update the UI to remove the warning.

### **Testing & Documentation Tasks:**
•	[ ] **Profile Unit Tests**: Write tests for the profile service and controller. This should include tests for retrieving profile data (ensuring it's only accessible to the authenticated user), updating profile with valid data, and handling of invalid data (e.g., invalid email or overly large avatar upload should be rejected).

•	[ ] **Password Change Tests**: Include tests to verify that the password change endpoint works correctly – correct current password allows change, wrong current password is rejected, and that after changing, the old password no longer works for login.

•	[ ] **Account State Enforcement Tests**: Simulate scenarios for user states – e.g., create a test user marked as "suspended" and ensure that logging in with that user is blocked by the auth system. Similarly test that an email verification-required user cannot access protected endpoints until their status changes.

•	[ ] **API Docs (Profile)**: Document the profile and account endpoints in the API documentation. For example, include the route and schema for GET /api/profile, PUT /api/profile, POST /api/profile/avatar, POST /api/profile/password (change password), etc., with what each requires and returns.

•	[ ] **User Guide Documentation**: In end-user documentation or README, describe how a user can manage their profile once logged in. This might include steps or screenshots (if creating a guide) for updating profile info, changing password, enabling 2FA, etc. Ensuring this is documented will also help in testing these flows for completeness.

## 6. 🏢 Multi-Tenant & Organization Management

### **Backend API Tasks:**
•	[ ] **Tenant Schema & DB Setup**: Design the multi-tenant database schema. All key tables should include a tenantId field to segregate data. Use Prisma to define a Tenant model (organization) and ensure relationships between Tenant and other entities (User, etc.) include tenant scoping. Apply Postgres Row-Level Security policies to enforce tenant isolation at the database level.

•	[ ] **Tenant Context Middleware**: Implement NestJS middleware or guards to determine the current tenant for each request. This might involve decoding the JWT's tenant claim or reading a subdomain/headers. Ensure that every query executed through Prisma is filtered by the current tenant context (consider using a Prisma middleware or a BaseRepository pattern to auto-append tenantId filters).

•	[ ] **Onboarding – Tenant Creation on First Login**: Implement the deferred tenant creation logic. When a new user completes registration and logs in for the first time, check if they belong to a tenant. If not, automatically create a new Tenant record (e.g., using the user's name or a default) and assign that user the Owner role of the new tenant. This ensures each user ends up in a tenant even if they signed up individually. Include any initial setup for the tenant (like creating default settings or sample data if required).

•	[ ] **Tenant CRUD and Settings**: Provide endpoints for basic tenant management. At minimum, an endpoint to GET current tenant info (so the frontend can display organization name, logo, etc.), and possibly PUT update tenant (allowing the Owner to update organization name or other settings). If needed, include an endpoint to delete a tenant (likely an admin feature). All such endpoints must validate that the acting user is authorized (e.g., only tenant Owner or Admin can update tenant details).

•	[ ] **Tenant Switching Logic**: Support users belonging to multiple tenants. Define a strategy for how users switch context – e.g., by obtaining a new JWT for the selected tenant or by including a header/query parameter. Implement backend handling for tenant switching: possibly an endpoint like POST /api/tenants/switch that sets the current tenant (in a JWT or session) and returns updated tokens. Alternatively, issue multi-tenant JWTs with an array of tenant IDs and include a chosen tenant ID in requests. Ensure all subsequent requests respect the switched tenant context.

•	[ ] **Organization Branding**: Allow each tenant to have custom branding settings. Extend the Tenant model to include fields like logo URL, theme color, etc. Implement an endpoint for tenant admins to update these branding assets (e.g., upload a new logo image via file service and save URL, set theme preferences). If supporting custom domains per tenant, include backend logic to map a domain to a tenant (and handle this in middleware for identifying tenant by request host).

•	[ ] **Feature Flags per Tenant**: Implement a feature flag system to enable/disable features on a per-tenant basis. Create a FeatureFlag entity (with tenantId, featureKey, enabled status) or use a JSON column in Tenant for feature settings. Provide a service to check if a feature is active for a given tenant (to be used by guards or conditionals in code). If tenants are on different plans, this can tie into plan features (e.g., advanced features only enabled for premium plans). Ensure there's a secure API or admin interface to toggle these flags.

•	[ ] **Tenant Usage Analytics**: Build backend support for tracking usage per tenant. Define what metrics to collect (e.g., number of users, API calls, storage used, last active date, etc.). Implement a service that aggregates these metrics (possibly via event listeners or cron jobs). Store the results in a Usage or Analytics entity keyed by tenant. Provide an endpoint for tenant admins to retrieve their usage stats (to display in a dashboard or for billing purposes).

•	[ ] **Roles & Permissions Management**: Extend user management to handle roles within tenants. Ensure that when a user is created or invited into a tenant, they have an associated role (Owner, Admin, etc.). Implement endpoints for tenant Owners/Admins to update a member's role (except Owner which might be fixed to the creator). This could be part of a "manage members" API. Enforce these roles in the authorization guards (already implemented in Auth module).

•	[ ] **Invitation System**: Develop an invitation workflow for adding users to a tenant. Create an endpoint (for tenant Admins) to invite a user via email, specifying their role. Generate an invite token tied to the tenant and send it via email (using the Notification system). Create an endpoint for invite acceptance: when the invite link is used, allow the user to register (if they don't have an account) or simply accept if they are logged in with an existing account, then associate that user with the tenant in the specified role. Handle token expiration and invalidation after use.

•	[ ] **Team/Sub-Tenant Structure (Optional)**: If supporting sub-teams or departments within a tenant, implement team management. Create a Team entity (with tenantId and maybe a hierarchy or type) and an association of users to Teams. Provide endpoints to create/update/delete teams (tenant Admin scope) and to add or remove users to teams. This also requires adjusting the context: e.g., in addition to tenant context, some operations might be filtered by team. Ensure that team membership and roles interplay is handled (e.g., a user might have a role per team or roles might be tenant-wide; clarify model and enforce rules accordingly).

•	[ ] **Bulk User Import/Export**: Implement bulk operations for user management within a tenant. Provide an endpoint for tenant Admins to import users via CSV file – this should accept a file (or handle a previously uploaded file), parse it (using the File/Document module capabilities), and queue a background job to create users or send invites for each entry. Store results (successes/failures) and provide a way to retrieve the import progress/status. Likewise, implement an endpoint to export the tenant's users to CSV for download (leveraging a CSV generation utility). Ensure large imports are handled asynchronously and that appropriate notifications or logs are generated on completion.

### **Frontend UI Tasks:**
•	[ ] First-Time Onboarding Flow: Implement a post-registration onboarding UI for new users with no tenant. For example, after first login, if the user has no organization, present a setup screen to create their organization. Let them input an organization name (and maybe some optional details like org logo) and call the API to create the tenant (or rely on the backend auto-create and just update the name/logo via an API). After this, proceed to the main app with the new tenant context.
•	[ ] Tenant Switcher UI: If a user belongs to multiple organizations, provide a clear UI control to switch tenants. This could be a dropdown in the header showing the current organization name, which on click lists other organizations the user is a member of. Selecting one will trigger the tenant switch (e.g., call the switch API or reload the app with a different context). Ensure that the UI refreshes data according to the selected tenant (you may need to reset state/query caches on switch).
•	[ ] Organization Settings Page: Create a dedicated page for Organization settings, visible to tenant admins. This should display the tenant’s profile (organization name, logo, domain if any, etc.) and allow edits. Include an interface to upload a new organization logo (reuse file upload component) and update other branding settings like theme color or tagline. If custom domains are supported, show the current domain and instructions or input to set a new domain (possibly this might be read-only info with an external process to validate domains).
•	[ ] Member Management UI: Develop a "Members" page where tenant Owners/Admins can manage user membership. Display a list of all users in the tenant with their roles. For each member (except perhaps the Owner), allow actions such as changing their role (via a dropdown or edit action) and removing the user from the organization. If the app supports user status management at the tenant level (e.g., suspending a user within a tenant), include controls for that as well.
•	[ ] Invite Members Flow: On the Members page, include a form or modal to invite a new member via email. This should collect the email address (and possibly allow choosing a role for the invitee). On submission, call the invite API. Provide UI feedback for successful invites (e.g., "Invitation sent to X") and handle error cases (like inviting an existing member, or if email already in use in the tenant).
•	[ ] Team Management UI (if applicable): If teams/sub-groups are implemented, provide UI to manage them. This could be a sub-section in organization settings or a separate page. Allow admins to create new teams (give them a name), see a list of teams, and inside each team, manage members (add/remove users, possibly assign team-specific roles if that concept exists). Also allow users to navigate or filter content by team context. If a team context switch is needed (in addition to tenant switch), provide a similar UI control for team selection when within a tenant.
•	[ ] Usage Dashboard: For tenant Admins, create a simple dashboard or section in org settings that shows usage analytics for their organization. This might include stats like number of active users, total files stored or storage space used, number of projects (if applicable), or any other key usage metric. Display these in a visually clear way (e.g., summary cards or a chart for usage over time). This will help tenants understand their own usage and possibly how it relates to their billing if usage limits exist.
•	[ ] Feature Availability UI: If certain features are gated by feature flags or plan, the frontend should check which features are enabled for the current tenant and adjust the UI accordingly. For instance, hide menu items for features that are not enabled for that tenant, or show a message that a feature is an upgrade. Ensure these conditions are centrally checked (perhaps via an API call on login that returns enabled features) so the UI can conditionally render parts.
Testing & Documentation Tasks
•	[ ] Tenant Isolation Tests: Create tests to ensure enforcement of tenant isolation. For example, use direct API calls in a test to verify that a user from Tenant A cannot access data from Tenant B (attempt to fetch or modify resources with another tenant’s ID and expect a 403/404). If using RLS, also test that direct DB queries (via Prisma without tenant context) are not possible in normal code paths.
•	[ ] Onboarding Flow Test: Write an end-to-end test simulating a new user signup and first login. The test should verify that after login, a new tenant is created for the user (check via API or DB), and that the user is assigned as Owner. Then verify that the frontend is prompted for org setup (if applicable) and that after completion, the user can access tenant-specific endpoints without issue.
•	[ ] Invite Flow Test: Develop integration tests for the invitation system. For instance: an Admin invites a new user, the system creates an invite token; simulate the invited user redeeming the invite (this might be tricky to fully automate, but you can call the accept-invite API with the token). Verify that the invited user is now associated with the tenant with the correct role and that the token cannot be reused.
•	[ ] Role & Permission Tests: Test that users with different roles have the correct access. For example, ensure a Manager cannot perform admin-level actions like deleting the tenant or managing billing if those are restricted. You can write tests that log in as different role users and attempt certain actions, expecting success or forbidden as appropriate.
•	[ ] Team Functionality Tests: If teams are implemented, test that team scoping works. For example, create two teams under one tenant, add users accordingly, and ensure that a user only sees data for their selected team. This might involve simulating team switching and verifying that data returned by an API is filtered by team.
•	[ ] Bulk Import Test: Use a test to simulate uploading a CSV of users for import. You might call a lower-level function with sample CSV content rather than an actual file upload in the test environment. Verify that the background job logic parses the file and creates the users or invitations. Also test the outcome (e.g., that users are created in the DB, and that an import log or summary is available).
•	[ ] Documentation – Multi-Tenancy: Write a section in the developer documentation detailing the multi-tenant architecture. This should explain how tenant context is determined, how to add new tenant-scoped modules, and best practices (like always querying within tenant scope). Include notes on the first-login tenant creation and any configuration needed for custom domain support.
•	[ ] Documentation – User Management: Ensure the README or docs cover how an admin can manage users: inviting users, removing users, and the roles hierarchy. If there are any admin CLI scripts or special steps to manage tenants or users, document them here. Provide examples of using the API for common org management tasks (maybe via Postman examples).

## 7. 💳 Billing & Payments

### **Backend API Tasks:**
•	[ ] Stripe Integration Setup: Integrate Stripe for payment processing. Configure the Stripe API keys and SDK in the backend, and create a Stripe webhook endpoint to receive events (e.g., invoice paid, payment failed). Implement secure webhook handling: verify Stripe signatures and respond to events accordingly (e.g., update subscription status on payment success/failure).
•	[ ] Subscription Plan Management: Define subscription plans in the system. This might involve a seed or config for plan details (e.g., Free, Pro, Enterprise with different limits) and corresponding Product/Price IDs in Stripe. Implement an API to retrieve available plans for the frontend. (If allowing dynamic plan management, perhaps an admin interface to create/update plans, otherwise plans are mostly static and managed in Stripe dashboard with matching constants in code.)
•	[ ] Subscription Lifecycle: Implement backend services to handle subscription creation, upgrades, downgrades, and cancellation. For example, an endpoint to subscribe a tenant to a plan (creating a Customer and Subscription in Stripe), an endpoint to change the current plan (which may involve proration – leverage Stripe’s proration behavior or calculate proration amounts), and an endpoint to cancel a subscription (either immediate or end of period). Ensure that changing plans triggers appropriate Stripe API calls and that the system updates the tenant’s record (e.g., plan type, active until date).
•	[ ] Payment Method Management: Provide endpoints to manage payment methods for a customer. For instance, an endpoint to add a new payment method (this might use Stripe’s SetupIntent to securely collect card info via the frontend), an endpoint to list saved payment methods (card last4, brand, exp date via Stripe), and one to remove a payment method. Ensure compliance by never handling raw card data on the backend – use Stripe Elements or Checkout on the frontend for card input, and just handle the resulting tokens or IDs.
•	[ ] Invoice Generation & Emails: Implement logic to handle invoice events. When Stripe generates an invoice (via webhook event), retrieve the invoice and generate a PDF version using the billing template. Consider using a PDF generation library (or Stripe’s invoice PDF if available) with customization for the tenant’s branding. Save the PDF to file storage or attach a link to the invoice record. If Stripe isn’t already emailing the invoice, send it to the tenant billing email via the notification system. Provide an API for tenants to download invoices (which will fetch the stored PDF or a secure Stripe link).
•	[ ] Dunning & Failed Payments: On payment failure events (invoice payment failed, charge failed), implement a dunning workflow. E.g., mark the subscription or tenant as past_due in the database, send out an email notification to update payment, schedule follow-up attempts (Stripe usually retries automatically; you can use the webhook to trigger additional actions like notifying admins or logging). Possibly implement escalating actions: after X days of non-payment, restrict account access (e.g., downgrade features or lock login behind a warning). Provide an endpoint or admin tool to reinstate access once payment issues are resolved.
•	[ ] Usage-Based Billing: If the platform has metered components, integrate usage tracking with billing. For example, if there’s a plan that charges for API calls or storage beyond a limit, record those usage events. Use Stripe’s metered billing (report usage via Stripe’s API) for those items each billing cycle. Ensure usage events include tenant identifiers and cannot be forged by clients (server-side increment). Also, consider an endpoint for admin to manually adjust usage in case of corrections.
•	[ ] Tax Calculation: Integrate tax support for global compliance. This can be using Stripe Tax or an external service. When creating subscriptions or invoices, provide location information (e.g., customer billing address) so Stripe can automatically calculate VAT/Sales Tax. If using an external tax provider, implement a service to calculate tax for a given transaction and include it on invoices. Also handle tax exemption logic: allow recording if a tenant is tax-exempt (e.g., entered a VAT ID) and ensure no tax is charged if valid. Keep records of tax rates applied for audit.
•	[ ] Multi-Tenant Billing Isolation: Ensure that each tenant’s billing data is isolated. Each tenant should have their own Stripe Customer ID and subscriptions. The backend should never mix up customers or charge one tenant for another’s usage. Include the tenantId on any internal billing records (like an Invoice entity if you have one). Also, in webhooks, determine which tenant the event belongs to by looking up the Stripe customer or subscription in your database. This isolation is critical for both security and clarity.
•	[ ] Revenue & Metrics Calculation: Implement background jobs or queries to calculate billing metrics. For instance, calculate Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) by summing all active subscription values, calculate churn rate (tenants or users who canceled), and other metrics like lifetime value. These calculations might run periodically and cache results for the Admin dashboard. Ensure accuracy by considering proration, cancellations mid-period, etc. Provide an internal API or service for the Admin module to fetch these aggregated metrics.
•	[ ] Error Handling & Logging: Implement robust error handling around billing operations. For example, wrap Stripe API calls in try/catch and log failures with enough detail to debug. If a webhook event processing fails (e.g., due to a temporary issue), mark it for retry or manual review. Consider implementing a retry mechanism for webhooks (Stripe will retry several times on its own) or an error queue for manual intervention. Log all critical billing events (payment succeeded, failed, subscription canceled, etc.) in a way that can be reviewed by support or in audit logs.
Frontend UI Tasks
•	[ ] Plans & Pricing Page: If not already publicly available, create a page in the app (or marketing site) that outlines the subscription plans available. For logged-in users, this could be part of the billing settings, showing what features each plan includes. Ensure this information is consistent with the backend (perhaps retrieved via API).
•	[ ] Billing Settings (Tenant Admin): Develop a Billing page accessible to tenant Owners/Admins. This page should display the tenant’s current subscription status: current plan name, price, next billing date, and payment method on file. If on a trial, show trial remaining time. Include a clear “Upgrade/Downgrade Plan” section: list available plans and allow the admin to select a new plan. On selection, handle the process (this might redirect to a Stripe Checkout session or open a modal for payment info if an upgrade requires it). Ensure the UI communicates if a downgrade will only apply after the current period or if any proration occurs.
•	[ ] Payment Method UI: Within Billing settings, provide an interface to manage payment methods. Show the current card on file (e.g., last4 and brand). Include a form (or Stripe Elements integration) to add a new credit card. This form should securely collect card details (using Stripe Elements or Stripe’s hosted form) and upon success, update the displayed payment method. Allow removal or switching of payment methods if multiple are supported – but ensure at least one default payment method remains for an active subscription.
•	[ ] Invoice History: On the Billing page, display a list of past invoices or billing history. Each entry should include the date, amount, status (paid, pending, failed), and a link to view or download the invoice PDF. For convenience, also allow the tenant admin to resend an invoice receipt to their email. Use the backend API to fetch the invoice list and PDF links (which might be secure links to your storage or Stripe’s hosted invoice PDFs).
•	[ ] Dunning Notifications UI: If an account is past due or a payment failed, surface this in the UI. For example, show a banner on the app (visible to admins) stating “Payment failed – please update your payment information to avoid interruption of service.” On the Billing page, highlight the issue and guide the user to update their card or retry payment. Once resolved, ensure the banner disappears.
•	[ ] Usage Tracking Display: If the plan has usage limits (e.g., X GB of storage, Y users, or API calls), show the current usage vs limit in the Billing or an Overview dashboard. For instance, “You have used 8 GB of 10 GB storage” with a progress bar, or “5 out of 10 team members used.” This data comes from the usage analytics the backend gathers. It helps the tenant see value and know if they need to upgrade.
•	[ ] Self-Service Portal Link: Optionally, integrate Stripe’s customer portal for self-service (if you choose to use it for things like updating payment methods or viewing invoices). Provide a button “Manage Subscription” that opens the Stripe hosted billing portal in a new tab (Stripe will handle authentication via a session token from the backend). If using this, some of the above custom UI (payment method, invoice history) may be partly handled by Stripe’s portal.
•	[ ] Plan Change Confirmation: When a tenant admin selects a new plan (upgrade or downgrade), implement a confirmation dialog or flow. If it’s an upgrade requiring immediate payment (or proration), you might direct them through a checkout. If it’s a downgrade, confirm that the change will apply at period end (to avoid accidentally losing features immediately). After confirming, show a success message and update the UI to reflect the new plan or scheduled change.
•	[ ] Graceful Feature Restriction: If a tenant is on a lower plan or in dunning (past due), ensure the frontend gracefully handles restricted features. For example, if the Free plan has no access to a certain module, hide or disable those UI elements with an upgrade prompt. Similarly, if the account is suspended for non-payment, you might restrict login or show only a payment update screen until resolved (depending on your chosen UX for dunning).
Testing & Documentation Tasks
•	[ ] Stripe Webhook Test: Use Stripe’s test mode and CLI/webhook tester to simulate events. Write integration tests that mimic Stripe webhook calls (e.g., invoice.payment_failed) by calling your webhook handler with sample event data, and assert that the system responds appropriately (marks invoice as failed, notifies user, etc.). Also test a successful payment event to ensure it updates subscription status.
•	[ ] Subscription Lifecycle Tests: In a development or staging environment, perform end-to-end tests of the subscription flows. For example, using Stripe test card numbers, go through: sign up a tenant, subscribe to a paid plan, ensure the subscription is created and the tenant is marked as such. Then test changing the plan (simulate upgrade/downgrade) and cancellation. Verify via the Stripe dashboard or API that the operations succeeded, and that your system’s database reflects the changes (plan, status, dates).
•	[ ] Payment Failure Scenario: Write a test scenario for dunning – e.g., manually mark a Stripe invoice as failed (in test mode you can trigger this), or advance subscription to past_due. Ensure the webhook triggers the appropriate logic in your app (like sending an email, flagging the tenant). Then simulate the user updating their card and Stripe’s payment retry succeeding; verify that the system clears the past_due status.
•	[ ] Unit Tests for Billing Logic: Develop unit tests for any complex billing calculations or tax logic. For instance, if you wrote a function to calculate proration or to compute MRR from active subscriptions, feed it known inputs and verify the outputs. If using Stripe’s calculations mostly, unit test that your integration code handles responses and errors correctly.
•	[ ] Security Tests: Ensure that tenants cannot interfere with each other’s billing. Write tests attempting to use one tenant’s token or IDs to fetch another tenant’s invoices or subscription info – the API should prevent this (likely via the auth/tenant guard, but good to have explicit tests).
•	[ ] API Documentation (Billing): Document all billing-related endpoints in the OpenAPI docs. Include the endpoints for subscription actions (subscribe, change plan, cancel), payment methods, invoice retrieval, etc. Also document any webhook endpoints (though they are internal, it’s useful for devs to know they exist) and any required configuration (like setting Stripe webhook secret in env).
•	[ ] Billing Guide: In the project documentation, provide a section on “Billing & Payments”. This should explain how the billing system is set up, how to configure Stripe keys, define plans, and handle common tasks (like what to do if a payment fails, how to upgrade a tenant via admin if needed). Include instructions for running in test mode versus production mode for Stripe.
•	[ ] Postman Tests for Billing: Add billing API calls to the Postman collection (e.g., an environment with Stripe test data). This helps manually test billing endpoints. You might include sample requests for creating a subscription, retrieving invoices, etc., which developers can use for reference or troubleshooting.

## 8. 📬 Communication & Notifications

### **Backend API Tasks:**
•	[ ] Email Service Setup: Implement an email service with provider abstraction. For example, use Nodemailer for SMTP and also support a provider like SendGrid or AWS SES. The configuration (API keys, SMTP creds) should be in environment variables. Ensure the service can easily switch between providers or use a fallback if one fails.
•	[ ] Email Templates: Develop a templating system for transactional emails. Use MJML templates (to ensure responsive HTML emails) compiled to HTML, and Handlebars (or a similar templating engine) to inject dynamic data. Create templates for common emails: verification email, password reset, invitation, payment receipt, etc. Provide a way to preview these templates during development (perhaps a Storybook for emails or a test endpoint that returns the rendered HTML).
•	[ ] Email Queue & Sending: Integrate BullMQ (Redis) to handle email sending in the background. When an email needs to be sent (e.g., user invites, password reset), add a job to the email queue with the template name and data. A worker will pick up jobs and actually send the emails via the email service. Implement retry logic for transient failures (and log errors for review). This ensures the main request threads aren’t slowed by email sending.
•	[ ] Email Delivery Tracking: Set up endpoints or handlers for email provider webhooks (if available) to track delivery status. E.g., receive events for delivered, opened, clicked, bounced, or dropped emails. Update a log or database record for the email (if you store emails sent) or update user’s contact status if an email bounces (could mark their email as unverified or flag for admin). This is important for list hygiene (removing or correcting bad emails) and for building features like showing last email open or engagement.
•	[ ] Notification Model: Design a Notification entity in the database to store in-app notification events (e.g., type, message, link, userId, read status, timestamp). This will be used for in-app notifications and history.
•	[ ] Multi-Channel Notifications: Extend the notification sending logic to support multiple channels. For example, define a function that given a notification event and user preferences, will send it via email, in-app, and/or SMS as appropriate. Integrate an SMS provider (like Twilio) for SMS notifications – add a service similar to the email service. (Mobile push can be considered later; for now, focus on email, in-app, SMS.) Respect user preferences in choosing channels.
•	[ ] User Notification Preferences: Create a model (or reuse profile settings) to store each user’s notification preferences. This might include global settings (e.g., “receive product updates: yes/no”) and channel settings (e.g., email vs SMS for certain notification types). Implement an API for the user to update these preferences (in the Profile or Settings module). Ensure that when sending notifications, the system checks these preferences (e.g., do not send marketing emails to those who opted out, send security alerts via SMS if that’s the user’s choice, etc.).
•	[ ] In-App Notification Service: Implement a service to create in-app notifications and store them. For example, when a certain event occurs (like someone mentions a user, or a new file is shared), create a Notification record in the DB for the affected user(s). This will allow the frontend to fetch and display the notification.
•	[ ] Real-Time Delivery (WebSockets): Connect the notifications system to WebSockets for instant delivery. When a new Notification record is created for a user, use the WebSocket gateway to emit a notification event to that user (if they are online). This means users see notifications appear in real-time without refreshing. If a user is offline, the notification will simply be available via the API when they come online.
•	[ ] Notification Center API: Provide an endpoint (e.g., GET /api/notifications) for users to retrieve their notifications (with pagination, most recent first). Also provide an endpoint to mark notifications as read (e.g., POST /api/notifications/mark-read for a given notification or all). Ensure these endpoints require auth and only return a user’s own notifications.
•	[ ] Scheduled & Batch Notifications: Implement capability for scheduled notifications or digests. For example, a daily summary email of notifications or a weekly newsletter. This might involve a cron job or scheduled BullMQ job that compiles notifications or updates over a period and sends one email. This is optional, but the infrastructure should allow adding such jobs easily.
•	[ ] Notification Throttling: To avoid spamming users, implement throttling rules for certain notification types. For example, if a user is mentioned 10 times in a minute, you might combine those into a single notification or at least not send 10 separate emails. This might require maintaining counters or timestamps of last sent notifications per type/user.
•	[ ] Unsubscribe Compliance: Ensure that all marketing or bulk notification emails include an unsubscribe link. Implement an endpoint that the unsubscribe link hits to mark that user as unsubscribed from that category of emails. Update their preferences accordingly. Also respect global unsubscribe (if a user clicks "unsubscribe from all", mark accordingly). For transactional emails (password resets, receipts), you typically don’t allow unsubscribe, but for anything promotional or bulk, you must.
•	[ ] Audit & Logging: Log the notifications sent (maybe store in a NotificationLog or use the Notification table for in-app). This is useful for troubleshooting (e.g., “user X did not receive Y email, why?”). At minimum, log email sends (to, template, time, success/failure). Also consider logging SMS sends similarly. This audit trail might be part of admin review in case of communication issues.
•	[ ] External Integrations (Optional): Provide the ability to send certain notifications to external systems if needed (e.g., Slack or webhook to an external URL). This can be an advanced feature: for example, allow a tenant to configure a Slack webhook URL, and when important notifications happen (like an error alert or support ticket), send a message to that Slack channel. This would involve storing integration settings and adding a channel in the sending logic. (This is optional and can be added later as needed.)
•	[ ] A/B Testing Framework (Optional): (Advanced/optional) Implement a simple mechanism to test different notification content. For example, have two variants of a marketing email and randomly send one to half the users and the other to the rest, then track open/click rates. This could be as simple as a flag on the template or a variation field on Notification events. This is a stretch goal for optimizing communication effectiveness.
Frontend UI Tasks
•	[ ] Notification Center UI: Implement an in-app notification center component. This could be an icon (bell) in the header that shows an unread count, and when clicked, opens a dropdown or sidebar listing recent notifications. Each notification item should display its content (text or title), possibly an icon for type, timestamp, and whether it’s read or new. If the notification has an associated link (e.g., to a document or page), clicking it should navigate the user there and mark it as read. Provide a way to view all notifications (either the dropdown scrolls or a dedicated notifications page with full history).
•	[ ] Real-Time UI Updates: Ensure that the notification center updates in real-time. Utilize the WebSocket connection: when a notification event arrives for the current user, increment the unread count and prepend the new notification to the list in the UI. Provide a visual highlight for a few seconds for new incoming notifications (to draw attention).
•	[ ] Mark as Read UX: Allow users to mark notifications as read. This can be done by: clicking on the notification to view its linked content (auto-mark as read), or an explicit “Mark all as read” button in the notification dropdown/page. Implement the UI for that and call the corresponding API. Also update the UI state (unread count and styling) immediately upon marking read.
•	[ ] Notification Preferences UI: Create a user-facing page or modal for notification settings. This would list different notification categories (e.g., Security Alerts, Messages, Newsletter, etc. – whatever categories apply in your app) and allow the user to choose how they receive each: Email, SMS, In-App, or not at all. Use toggles or checkboxes for each channel per category. This page will interact with the preferences API to load current settings and save changes. Make sure to validate inputs (e.g., if they turn on SMS notifications, ensure they have a phone number on file or prompt for one).
•	[ ] Email & SMS Verification UI (if needed): If users can add a phone number for SMS, provide UI to add/manage their phone number (likely in the profile or preferences page). This might include sending a verification code via SMS to confirm the number. Similarly, if they change their email (or if you allow multiple emails), handle verification flows. These are auxiliary to ensure the channels selected are valid.
•	[ ] Visual Indicators: In various parts of the UI, consider small indicators for new activity that tie into notifications. For instance, if there is a menu for “Messages” or “Comments” and those are tied to notifications, showing a red dot or badge on those menus when new items exist can improve user awareness. This can be driven by the same unread count or events that drive notifications.
•	[ ] Testing UI in Storybook/Dev: For complex components like the notification dropdown, ensure to include them in Storybook (if set up) with various states (no notifications, some unread, long list, etc.) to verify design and behavior. This will also serve as UI documentation for the notification component.
•	[ ] Responsive Design: Ensure the notification UI is usable on different screen sizes. For example, on mobile view (if the web app is responsive), the notification dropdown might become a full-screen list or a separate page route. Plan for how notifications are accessed on smaller screens and implement accordingly (though mobile app has separate considerations, the responsive web should still handle it if applicable).
Testing & Documentation Tasks
•	[ ] Email Integration Test: Write tests (possibly integration tests) for the email sending flow. One approach is to inject a test double for the email provider in the test environment that captures outgoing emails. Simulate triggering an email (like calling the invite API in a test) and assert that an email job was enqueued with correct parameters, and that the email service was called with the right template and recipient. You might not verify actual sending in tests (since that hits external services), but you can verify our code’s behavior up to that boundary.
•	[ ] Notification Flow Test: Create an end-to-end test for a sample notification scenario. For instance: User A mentions User B in a comment (if such a feature exists) which should trigger a notification to User B. In the test, perform the action that generates the notification, then verify that: (a) a Notification entry exists in the database for User B, (b) if User B’s preferences allow email, an email was queued, (c) if User B is connected via WebSocket in the test, they received a real-time notification event. This can be complex to do fully, but even testing parts of this (like the Notification DB entry and an API fetch showing it) is valuable.
•	[ ] Preference Enforcement Test: Ensure that user preferences are respected. Write tests where a user’s preferences are set to opt out of a certain notification type (e.g., marketing emails). Then simulate triggering that type of notification and assert that the user does not get an email (could check that no email job was created for them, or that the Notification entity is marked in-app only). Conversely, test that if they opt into SMS for a type, the system enqueues an SMS send. These might be unit tests where you directly call the notification dispatch function with a fake user preference context.
•	[ ] SMS Workflow Test: If SMS notifications are implemented, use a similar approach to email: inject a test SMS service in a test environment to capture outgoing SMS messages. Verify that when triggering certain notifications (like a 2FA OTP or alert), an SMS send is attempted to the correct number with correct content.
•	[ ] Frontend Notification Test: Utilize an end-to-end testing tool (Cypress or Playwright) to test the notification UI. For example, have a test where one user action causes a notification for another, then in the test script, switch to the second user’s view (or use two browser contexts) and assert that the notification bell shows an unread count, the list shows the new notification, and clicking it navigates properly. Also test marking as read (the count should decrement or disappear).
•	[ ] API Documentation (Notifications): Document all notification-related APIs in Swagger/OpenAPI. This includes: any /emails endpoints if exposed (often not), the /notifications GET/POST endpoints, the /preferences endpoints, etc. Provide example payloads for notification objects. Indicate that some of these are user-facing and some might be admin/internal.
•	[ ] Developer Docs: In the project documentation, add a Communication Module section. Explain how the email system is configured (providers, templates), how to add a new type of notification, and how the in-app notification and WebSocket integration works. This is important for future developers who want to extend or debug the notification system. Include instructions on setting up necessary third-party accounts (e.g., “Set SENDGRID_API_KEY in .env to enable email sending”) and testing tips (like using MailHog/Local SMTP in dev).
•	[ ] Compliance Documentation: Document how the system complies with communication regulations (CAN-SPAM, GDPR for communication preferences, etc.). For example, note that marketing emails honor unsubscribes and how an operator can manage the mailing list, or where bounce handling is logged (in case an email needs to be updated). This will be useful information for the team and any future audits.

## 9. 📁 File & Document Management

### **Backend API Tasks:**
•	[ ] File Storage Abstraction: Set up a flexible file storage module. Use an environment setting to choose the provider (e.g., local disk for development, AWS S3 or Supabase Storage for production). Implement a service that handles uploading (putObject) and downloading (getObject or presigned URLs) so that the rest of the app can use it without worrying about provider specifics. Ensure the storage buckets/containers are organized by tenant (e.g., prefix object keys with tenantId) to segregate data.
•	[ ] Secure Upload API: Implement an endpoint to initiate file uploads securely. Rather than posting raw files through the backend, use a strategy like pre-signed URLs. For example, POST /api/files/upload-url which takes file metadata (filename, size, type) and returns a one-time URL to PUT the file to storage. The endpoint should validate the requested file size/type against allowed limits (and the user’s plan). It should also attach metadata like tenantId and userId. The client will then upload directly to storage using this URL. For smaller files or simplicity, you could accept multipart file uploads at an endpoint and forward to storage, but presigned is preferred for large files.
•	[ ] Virus/Malware Scanning: Integrate a virus scanning step for uploaded files. Options: use a service like ClamAV (could run in a separate container), or a cloud malware scanning API. When a file is uploaded (maybe trigger scanning after upload completes via a webhook or event), scan the file. If a threat is detected, mark the file and prevent it from being accessed (or delete it). This can be done asynchronously – store an “unverified” status until scanning is done. Communicate to the user (in the UI) if a file was rejected due to virus.
•	[ ] File Type & Size Validation: Define what file types and sizes are allowed globally or per plan. Enforce this in the upload API – e.g., reject or don’t issue upload URL if the file type is not on the whitelist (to prevent things like .exe if not needed) or if size exceeds plan limit (or some reasonable safety limit). Keep these config values in a central config for easy adjustment.
•	[ ] File Entity & Metadata: Create a File entity in the database to track uploaded files. Fields might include: id, tenantId, userId (who uploaded), file name, storage path or key, file size, content type, upload date, maybe a flag for isDeleted or status (if scanning incomplete or failed). Every time a file is uploaded successfully, create a record. Implement GET /api/files endpoint to list files (with pagination, maybe filter by folder or tag) and GET /api/files/{id} for file info. These should enforce that only users from the respective tenant can access the info.
•	[ ] Folder Structure: Implement a way to organize files into “folders” or collections. You can have a Folder entity (with tenantId, name, parentFolderId for hierarchy) or simply treat folder as a path stored in the File record (like “folder/path/filename”). Choose one approach: an explicit Folder entity gives more structure (and allows permissions per folder if needed). Implement endpoints to CREATE folder, RENAME folder, DELETE folder (if empty or also delete contents). The list files endpoint should allow filtering by folder (to show contents).
•	[ ] File Listing & Search: Enhance the file listing to support searching and filtering. For example, allow a query param for filename search, which does a case-insensitive match on file names. Also consider supporting tag filtering: if you implement tagging (e.g., allow users to tag files with keywords), store those in a separate table or JSON field and filter accordingly. Provide these capabilities via the API (e.g., GET /api/files?search=text or ?tag=xyz).
•	[ ] File Download & Access Control: Implement a secure way to download files. This could be a GET /api/files/{id}/download endpoint that, after verifying the requester has access (correct tenant and any additional permissions), generates a short-lived URL or streams the file from storage. Alternatively, the API can redirect to a presigned URL. Ensure that if a file is marked private to certain user/role, that check is done too (for example, if later we allow per-file ACL). By default, tenant isolation is the main protection (only members of the tenant can access files of that tenant).
•	[ ] File Deletion: Implement a DELETE /api/files/{id} endpoint. This should remove the file record from the database and delete the actual file from storage. Consider soft-delete versus hard-delete: sometimes it’s good to keep metadata even if file is deleted, but generally if a user deletes a file we can remove it fully. Ensure only authorized users (like the file owner or tenant admin) can delete. If the file is in a folder, and the folder concept has cascading, handle accordingly.
•	[ ] File Versioning: Add support for file versioning (if applicable to your app). One approach: when a file is updated or uploaded with the same name in a location, instead of overwriting, create a new File record and link it as a new version of the original. Fields like previousVersionId or a version number can be used. Alternatively, have a separate FileVersion table linking to a File. Implement logic such that retrieving “the file” gives the latest version, and provide an endpoint to list versions or revert to an older version. This is an advanced feature – consider implementing basic support (store versions) but maybe not UI for revert initially unless needed.
•	[ ] Document Generation (PDF): Implement server-side PDF generation utilities for features that need PDFs (like invoices, or report exports). For example, set up Puppeteer or PDFKit to generate PDFs from HTML or templates. Provide a service method that given some data and a template can produce a PDF file (this may already be partially used in Billing for invoices). Ensure this runs in a background job if it’s heavy. Also, store or stream the generated PDFs appropriately (you might not store them permanently unless needed, sometimes on-the-fly generation is fine).
•	[ ] Spreadsheet Import/Export: Integrate a library like SheetJS to handle Excel/CSV import and export. Use this in features that require data import (e.g., user bulk import) or export (maybe exporting a list of users, or reports). On the import side, ensure validation of the input data and map it to your entities. On export, allow generating a CSV or Excel file for a dataset (this could be a general utility used by multiple modules, not necessarily exposed as a generic API).
•	[ ] Image Processing: For image files (like avatars or any uploaded images), integrate an image processing library (Sharp for Node) to generate optimized versions. For example, when a user uploads an image, create a thumbnail (e.g., 200x200px) and maybe a web-optimized version. Store these alongside the original (or in a variants structure). This is useful for displaying images quickly in the UI. Provide an API or direct URLs for these thumbnails as needed.
•	[ ] File Sharing (Permissions): Implement basic file sharing controls. Initially, the rule is all files belong to a tenant and all members can access them. If more granular control is needed: introduce an owner for each file (uploader) and perhaps an “isPublic” flag or shared links. For now, possibly allow generating a public pre-signed URL for a file (read-only) that can be shared with external users. This would be an endpoint that returns a URL valid for a short time (and maybe logs the access). Document that this should be used carefully. In the future, a more complex ACL system could be added, but that might be out of scope initially.
•	[ ] Storage Limits & Cleanup: Enforce storage quotas per tenant based on plan (if applicable). E.g., Free plan has 5 GB limit – before issuing upload URLs or accepting new files, check the tenant’s current storage usage (sum of file sizes) and deny if it would exceed the limit. Provide meaningful error messages that the tenant has run out of storage. Also, consider implementing cleanup jobs: e.g., a job that flags or purges old files (if retention policy is needed). For example, if you have file versioning, maybe auto-delete versions older than X days if not needed. Or clean temporary files if any.
•	[ ] Backup & Recovery: Although more of an ops concern, ensure that files stored are backed up (this may be through the storage provider’s guarantees or manual backups). From the app perspective, perhaps provide an admin function to export or backup a tenant’s files (e.g., zipping all files for a tenant for download – useful if a tenant leaves and wants their data). This could be an endpoint that only platform admins can call, which streams all files of a tenant in a zip.
Frontend UI Tasks
•	[ ] File Manager UI: Build a File Manager interface in the app (especially if the product involves users managing files). This could be a page within the dashboard where users can see files and folders for their tenant. Display a hierarchical view if using folders: perhaps a sidebar tree for folders and a main pane for contents, or a simple breadcrumb navigation. Show file names, maybe icons or thumbnails for known types (images, pdf, doc, etc.), file size and upload date. Implement sorting (by name, date, size).
•	[ ] File Upload UI: Provide a user-friendly way to upload files. This could be an “Upload” button that opens a file picker, and/or drag-and-drop area in the File Manager. When files are selected, initiate the upload: call the backend to get a presigned URL (and any required fields if using AWS S3 POST upload), then perform the file upload directly to storage. Show a progress bar for each file uploading. Handle success (perhaps show the new file in the list) and errors (file too large, forbidden type, etc. with clear messages). Allow multiple files to be queued for upload.
•	[ ] Folder Management UI: In the file manager, allow users to create new folders (a “New Folder” button that prompts for name), and to rename or delete folders (probably via a context menu or right-click if desktop UI metaphors are used, or a small dropdown of actions for each folder). Make sure deleting a folder either requires it to be empty or offers to delete all contents (with a big warning). Updating the UI should reflect created/removed folders immediately.
•	[ ] File Actions UI: For each file listed, provide actions like Download, Rename, Delete, maybe Share. This could be via a “…” context menu on each file row or icon. Download will hit the download API (or directly open the file if you have a public URL) – ensure it triggers the browser to download or view. Rename could be inline edit of the filename (with an API call to update it). Delete will prompt confirmation (“Are you sure?” because it’s irreversible) then call delete API and on success remove the file from the list. Share (if implemented) could open a dialog with a sharable link that is fetched from an API.
•	[ ] File Preview: For user convenience, implement previews for certain file types. For images: when clicking an image file, show a lightbox or preview modal displaying the image (perhaps the larger or original version). For PDFs: optionally, show a PDF viewer or prompt to download. For common text-based files (txt, code, etc.), you could display the text content in a modal. This isn’t strictly required by PRD but improves UX for a file manager. Ensure the preview uses the appropriate URLs to fetch the content (and that those are secured via auth or presigned URLs).
•	[ ] Thumbnails: In a grid or list, display thumbnail images for image files (and perhaps PDF first page thumbnails if that is feasible to generate). This makes the file manager visually richer. These thumbnails would come from the backend’s image processing of uploads. For other file types, use a generic icon (e.g., a PDF icon, a Word doc icon, etc.).
•	[ ] Search UI: If search is supported, put a search bar in the file manager. As the user types, either live filter the displayed files by name (if the dataset is small) or on submit, call the API with the query to retrieve matching files. Show results, possibly with an indication if they are in different folders (or maybe ignore folder grouping in search results for simplicity).
•	[ ] Pagination or Virtualization: If a tenant can have a lot of files, implement either pagination (load next page of files via API) or UI virtualization for performance. Ensure the UI indicates loading state when fetching more files. This ties into the backend’s pagination support on the list files API.
•	[ ] Upload Constraints Feedback: In the upload UI, guide the user on allowed file types/sizes. E.g., display “Max file size: 100MB. Allowed types: PDF, DOCX, PNG, JPG” or similar in the upload dialog. This sets expectations and matches the backend validation. If the user tries to drop a forbidden file, show an immediate error (even before uploading, if possible).
•	[ ] Integration Points: If the platform’s other modules use files (for example, attaching files to messages or records), integrate the file manager or at least the file service UI into those flows. Perhaps provide a mini file picker that opens the file manager in a dialog for selecting an existing file to attach. Ensure consistency so that files uploaded via one feature still appear in the file manager (assuming all files are stored centrally per tenant).
•	[ ] Responsive & Mobile View: Ensure the file management UI is responsive. On smaller screens, a grid of files might collapse to a single column list. The drag-and-drop might not work on mobile, so provide a basic upload button for mobile. Navigation of folders might become a simple list with back arrows rather than a tree. Even though mobile app is separate, some users might use the web app on a tablet/phone browser, so the experience should be passable.
Testing & Documentation Tasks
•	[ ] Storage Service Tests: Write unit tests for the storage service abstraction. Use a local filesystem or a mock in tests to simulate S3. Test that requesting an upload URL returns a valid URL (perhaps stub the S3 SDK to not actually call external). Test that the service correctly forms object keys (especially including tenantId, etc.), and that deletion function calls the right provider method.
•	[ ] File API Integration Tests: After uploading files (you can simulate an upload by calling the internal functions to pretend a file was uploaded, or for a full test, use the upload URL approach if possible), test that the list and download endpoints work correctly. E.g., create a file record as if it were uploaded, then call GET /api/files and expect it in the response. Test that a user from another tenant cannot see or fetch that file (should get 404 or 403). Test that deleting a file removes the record (and ideally that the file no longer exists in the storage, though that might be tricky to verify in a test without checking the provider, which you could mock).
•	[ ] Virus Scanning Test: If virus scanning is implemented, write a test for it. Possibly mark a test file as containing a virus signature (you could simulate by calling the scanning function on a dummy data and forcing a “detected” result). Verify the system’s reaction (e.g., the file record marked infected or not saved at all, user notified somehow, etc.). This might involve mocking the virus scanner’s response in a unit test.
•	[ ] File Versioning Test: If versioning is supported, create a scenario: upload a file, then “upload a new version” of the same file (this might be through the same endpoint or a special one). Verify that the original file record is either updated to point to the new version or that a new record with link to old is created. Test that listing files either shows one entry (latest version) or both depending on design. Ensure the older version is accessible only through a version history endpoint if provided.
•	[ ] UI Tests for File Manager: With Cypress/Playwright, automate a few critical flows: upload a file via the UI (this can be done by simulating file select – these tools allow attaching a file to an input). Then check that the file appears in the list. Delete the file via the UI and confirm it disappears. If possible, test folder creation: create a folder, verify it shows, upload a file into it (the UI might need to navigate into the folder then upload). Ensure that moving between folders updates the file list.
•	[ ] Limits Enforcement Test: Simulate a scenario where the tenant’s storage is near quota. You can, for testing, lower the quota for a tenant to a small number and then attempt an upload that exceeds it. The API should reject it; test that this comes through to the UI (likely as an error message). Conversely, test that an allowed file size passes.
•	[ ] Documentation – File Storage: In the developer docs, add a section on File Management. Explain the storage providers supported and how to configure them (AWS credentials, etc.). Document the security approach (tenant isolation, presigned URLs) so developers understand the rationale. Include any setup required (for virus scanning service, or bucket setup).
•	[ ] API Docs (Files): Ensure the OpenAPI documentation covers the file upload flow. This is tricky since it might involve presigned URLs (which are external), but document the /files/upload-url endpoint, the /files list and delete endpoints, etc. Explain the need to use the presigned URL for the actual file content upload. Also document any file metadata schema (like what a File object contains in responses).
•	[ ] User Guide for Files: If applicable, provide some end-user documentation on using the file manager. For instance, a section in a user manual or help docs about uploading files, types allowed, size limits, and how to use the file manager UI. This may not be a priority for developer docs, but if any user-facing docs exist, it’s good to cover.

## 10. ⚡ Real-Time Features (WebSockets)

### **Backend API Tasks:**
•	[ ] WebSocket Gateway Setup: Integrate NestJS WebSockets (using Socket.io under the hood for broad compatibility) to enable real-time communication. Create a WebSocket gateway (e.g., EventsGateway) that handles connection events. Use JWT authentication during the handshake (e.g., accept a token query parameter or perform a cookie JWT verification) to ensure only authenticated users connect. Reject connections without valid auth.
•	[ ] Scaling & PubSub: Configure the WebSocket gateway for horizontal scaling. Use a Redis adapter for Socket.io so that if the app is running on multiple instances, they can coordinate (Redis will be used to pub/sub messages to all instances). Document the need to have a Redis instance for this in production. Test that broadcasting messages reaches clients on all nodes (this may be more of an infrastructure check).
•	[ ] Room Management: Define and implement a strategy for rooms (channels) to organize real-time events. For example, join each connected socket to a room for their tenant: tenant-{tenantId} so that tenant-wide events can be emitted easily. If collaborative features require more granular rooms (like a room per document or per chat), implement the logic to have users join those rooms when appropriate. (This could be done on-demand via events, e.g., when a user opens a document, server adds them to document-{id} room.)
•	[ ] Presence Service: Implement a basic presence tracking system. Use a Redis data structure or in-memory map to keep track of online users per tenant (and per room if needed). For example, on socket connect, mark that userId is online (perhaps set a key in Redis like online:tenant:{tenantId} with a set of userIds). On disconnect, remove from those sets after a short delay (to handle quick reconnects). The presence info can be broadcast to interested clients: e.g., emit an event presence:update with who’s online/offline to members of a room or tenant whenever a change occurs.
•	[ ] Message/Event Broadcasting: Build backend support for broadcasting relevant events to the right rooms. For tenant-scoped events (like a new announcement or notification), broadcast to the tenant-{tenantId} room. For team-scoped events, use team-{teamId} if applicable. For user-specific events (like a direct notification), Socket.io can target the socket by userId if you map userId to socket ID. Ensure helper methods exist to emit events easily from anywhere in the backend (for example, a Notification service can call a WebSocket service to emit notification:new to a specific user or tenant room).
•	[ ] Offline Queueing: Decide how to handle events for offline users. For example, for critical events like chat messages, if a user is offline, the event could be stored. The simplest approach: rely on the Notification system and on fetching missed data when they reconnect (e.g., when they open the chat, load history from DB). Alternatively, implement a Redis-backed queue for each user to hold missed messages. A pragmatic solution is to integrate with the notifications: e.g., if a user gets a chat message while offline, create an in-app notification or send an email. Document this behavior.
•	[ ] Activity Feeds: Set up an activity feed mechanism for collaborative events. For example, maintain an Activity entity for events like “User X updated record Y” or “User A joined the team”. Whenever such an action happens, create an Activity record in the DB and emit a WebSocket event activity:new to the relevant room (tenant or team). Clients can listen and update their feed UI instantly. Provide an API to retrieve historical activities (so when a user opens the app, they can load recent feed items).
•	[ ] Collaborative Editing Support: Lay the groundwork for collaborative editing. Full CRDT or OT-based collaboration might be out of scope, but implement a simple real-time syncing mechanism as a proof of concept. For example, for a “notes” feature, when one user edits a note, emit events like note:change with the updated content or patch. Other clients receive it and update their view. Locking or conflict resolution might be minimal; assume low collision for initial version. Use a library if needed for text diffing, or keep it basic. The key is to demonstrate multi-user updates.
•	[ ] Chat Service: Implement a simple real-time chat service. This could be a general “tenant chat” or specific to teams or support. Create a ChatMessage entity (tenantId, senderId, message text, timestamp, maybe roomId if multiple chats). Provide an API to fetch chat history (last N messages) for a room. When a new message is created via an API call or WebSocket event from a client, save it to DB and broadcast it to the room’s sockets (chat:new event with message data). Also handle related features: possibly typing indicators (when a user is typing, broadcast chat:typing events to others) and read receipts (if desired, though can be complex – maybe skip for now or just mark messages as read when fetched).
•	[ ] Global System Notifications: Implement functionality to send system-wide alerts in real-time. For example, a platform admin might trigger a maintenance mode warning to all connected users. Designate a special room like global or simply iterate over tenant rooms. The WebSocket gateway can have a method to broadcast to all connected sockets. Use this carefully (only for important messages). This could be triggered via an admin endpoint or script.
•	[ ] WebSocket Event Security: Ensure that only authorized clients can join certain rooms or perform certain actions. For instance, a user should only join their own tenant’s room, not any arbitrary room (the server should handle room assignment and ignore any join attempts to disallowed rooms). Also, if you allow clients to emit certain events (like sending a chat message), validate on the server side — e.g., if a chat message event comes in, check the user’s identity and that they belong to that tenant/team before broadcasting it. Never trust the client to specify the recipient or room without verification.
•	[ ] Connection Stability & Heartbeat: Implement heartbeat or ping-pong mechanisms if not already handled by Socket.io to detect dropped connections. Configure a reasonable ping interval and timeout. This helps the server promptly know a client is gone and update presence. Additionally, handle the scenario of reconnect: when a client reconnects (which Socket.io will attempt), rejoin them to the appropriate rooms (Socket.io does this automatically if using the same rooms logic on both sides, but ensure any stateful info is restored).
•	[ ] Rate Limiting & Flood Control: To prevent misuse, add rate limiting for certain events. For example, limit chat messages to, say, 5 per second per user to avoid spam. If a user exceeds that, you might drop events or disconnect them temporarily. Implement checks in the event handlers for these scenarios.
•	[ ] Logging & Monitoring: Instrument the WebSocket system with logging. Log when users connect/disconnect and to which tenant (maybe at debug level to avoid too much in production). Monitor the number of active connections and rooms. If using a monitoring solution (Prometheus, etc.), expose metrics like count of connected clients, messages per minute, etc.. This will help in scaling decisions.
Frontend UI Tasks
•	[ ] WebSocket Client Integration: Set up the front-end to connect to the WebSocket gateway after user login. Use the appropriate client library (Socket.io client) and provide the JWT for auth (e.g., as a query param or header during the handshake). Ensure the client automatically reconnects on disconnect (Socket.io by default does). Manage the connection in a global context or service so it’s available to various components. Possibly reconnect with updated token on token refresh if using auth tokens.
•	[ ] Online Presence Indicators: Utilize the presence events to show which users are online. For example, in a team member list or user avatar UI, show a green dot for online users. Update these in real-time when presence:update events come in. Also, possibly show “last seen” info if provided (though that might be more of a static info updated via presence offline events with timestamps).
•	[ ] Activity Feed UI: Implement a real-time activity feed component for the app. This could be on the dashboard or a side panel that shows a running log of notable events (based on the Activity events broadcast). Each feed item might display an icon, a message (e.g., “John uploaded a file”), and a timestamp. The feed updates live as events come in via WebSocket. Also allow scrolling through recent history by fetching older activities via an API when the user scrolls up or a “Load more” button.
•	[ ] Real-Time Chat UI: Create a chat interface for users to send and receive messages in real-time. This could be a dedicated page or a modal/pop-up component. Display the conversation (messages in order, who sent them, time). Provide an input box for sending new messages. When user sends, emit a WebSocket event or call an API (depending on design, but likely directly emit for low latency) and optimistically add the message to the UI. When messages are received (including the one the user sent, echoed back from server with maybe an ID), ensure they display properly. Handle basic features: scroll to bottom on new message if the user is near bottom, show an indicator if new messages arrive while scrolled up (like “New messages” prompt).
•	[ ] Typing Indicators: In the chat UI, implement typing indicators if possible. For example, when a user is typing, emit a small event like chat:typing (throttled, e.g., start and stop events). Other clients on receiving typing event for user X can show “X is typing…” in the UI. This adds a nice real-time touch. Make sure to clear the indicator after a few seconds or when a stop event is received.
•	[ ] Collaborative Editing UI: If collaborative editing was implemented, create a simple UI to demonstrate it. For instance, a “Collaborative Notes” page with a shared text area or rich-text editor that multiple users can edit simultaneously. Use a library if needed for rich text (or just a plain textarea for simplicity). When the user types, send their changes via WebSocket events (or the entire content periodically). Apply incoming changes from other users to the editor. This is complex to get perfect (and out-of-scope for heavy conflict resolution), but even a basic implementation where last writer wins can show the concept. Indicate other users’ presence in the document (e.g., show their name or cursor position if feasible with a library).
•	[ ] Notification via WebSocket: Ensure that the Notification Center (from the Notifications module) is tied into WebSocket events for real-time delivery. If not already handled, subscribe to notification events so that notifications appear instantly. This is more of an integration: likely already covered in the Notifications UI tasks, but worth verifying that the WebSocket client on the frontend listens for, say, notification:new events and treats them the same as if it polled the API.
•	[ ] System Alerts UI: Handle any system-wide notifications (like maintenance alerts) by listening for a global event (perhaps system:alert). If received, show a prominent banner or modal in the app with the message (which could be something like “The system will undergo maintenance at 00:00 UTC” or “Emergency notice: ...”). Provide a close option if it’s dismissible, but some alerts might remain until resolved.
•	[ ] Optimistic UI & Reconnects: Ensure the frontend can handle disconnects gracefully. For instance, if the socket connection drops (network issue), perhaps show a small “Reconnecting...” indicator somewhere if it lasts more than a few seconds. When reconnected, automatically resync any essential data – e.g., refetch the activity feed or presence because some events might have been missed during disconnect. Often, one can rely on fetching when opening sections, but consider a general strategy for resynchronization.
•	[ ] Performance Considerations: If certain real-time features could generate a lot of events (like very active chat), ensure the frontend efficiently updates the DOM (use techniques like windowing for long lists of messages, or batching state updates). Test with e.g. 1000 chat messages to see that the app is still responsive. Possibly implement a cap where older messages are unloaded if not visible (just to avoid extreme memory usage).
•	[ ] Testing Real-Time UX: As part of development, test the real-time interactions manually with multiple accounts/browsers side by side. This will help catch any issues with events not reaching or UI not updating. Write down expected behaviors for tricky scenarios (like two users editing the same item) and ensure the implementation covers them as well as reasonable for now.
Testing & Documentation Tasks
•	[ ] WebSocket Connection Test: Write tests to ensure the WebSocket handshake requires auth. This could be a unit test of the JWT guard in the gateway or a lightweight integration test using a Socket.io client pointing to the test server. Attempt to connect without a token (expect rejection) and with a valid token (expect connection success).
•	[ ] Room Subscription Test: If possible, test that upon connection, the server correctly adds the socket to the appropriate rooms. This might involve calling some internal gateway methods. Alternatively, after a simulated event, verify that only the intended recipients receive it. For example, connect two clients with different tenant tokens, emit an event to tenant A’s room and verify (perhaps via a spy or the client’s event handler) that the client for tenant A got it and tenant B did not. This may require a running server in a test environment – consider using a dedicated Jest environment or a script with Socket.io client to do this.
•	[ ] Presence Logic Test: Unit test the presence tracking logic (likely encapsulated in a service or within the gateway). Simulate users connecting and disconnecting by calling those methods with user IDs and ensure the data structure updates. If using Redis, you could abstract the data layer to a service that can be mocked for unit tests, or use a test Redis instance. Also test edge cases: user opens two browser tabs (two sockets, same user) – ensure that if one disconnects, the user is still shown online until all their sockets disconnect.
•	[ ] Activity Feed Test: Write an integration test for the activity feed scenario. Possibly: perform an action in a test (like call a controller method to simulate “user updated something” which should trigger an Activity creation and event). Then use a WebSocket test client to listen for activity:new and assert it receives the expected payload. Also test the Activity REST API (if you have one for fetching history) returns the events including the new one.
•	[ ] Chat Functionality Test: Similar to above, test the chat feature. Possibly using two WebSocket clients in a test, have one send a chat message event, and verify the other receives it. Also verify the message was saved to the database. If your API allows, fetch the chat history and ensure the message appears. Test some edge conditions like sending an empty message is handled (maybe validation prevents it).
•	[ ] Collaborative Edit Test: This might be hard to test automatically without a specialized setup. You could simulate two clients editing by firing a sequence of events to the server and asserting the final state. If not easily automated, ensure to test manually and document any limitations (like “last write wins if simultaneous”).
•	[ ] Load Test (Optional): As a specialized test, you might simulate many WebSocket connections to see that the system can handle it (could be done with a script or an external tool). Not required in normal CI, but do some form of stress test and record results. Ensure no memory leaks or crashes under high frequency of events. Document these results for future scaling considerations.
•	[ ] Documentation – Real-Time Architecture: In the developer docs, add a section Real-Time Features. Describe the WebSocket setup, authentication method, and how rooms are organized (tenants, teams, etc.). Document each major event/channel: e.g., “activity:new – broadcast when an activity feed item is created”, “chat:new – when a new chat message is sent”, “presence:update – user online/offline notifications”, etc. This serves as a reference for developers and helps when debugging or extending the system.
•	[ ] Usage Guide: Provide a brief guide on how the real-time features improve the app usage. For instance, in an admin manual or user guide, mention that “You will see updates (like new messages or changes) in real-time without needing to refresh.” This isn’t a how-to (since it’s automatic), but sets expectation that the system has live updates. If any feature like collaborative editing is available, explain how multiple users can edit simultaneously and what to expect.
•	[ ] Monitoring & Alerts: Ensure that any operations team or future maintainer knows about the WebSocket aspect. In docs, note any special requirements (like needing the Redis adapter for multi-instance deployments). Also note how to monitor the WebSocket server (e.g., using provided metrics or logs) to catch issues like an excess of connections or failed connections.

## 11. ⚙️ Admin Panel & System Management

### **Backend API Tasks:**
•	[ ] Platform Admin Role: Establish a Super Admin role for platform-wide administration. This can be implemented by having a special tenant (e.g., tenant ID 1 as the “platform” tenant) and any user belonging to that tenant with role “Super Admin” is considered a platform admin. Alternatively, a flag in the User model could denote super admin. Decide on one and implement accordingly. Ensure that the auth system (guards) can recognize super admins and grant them access to admin routes.
•	[ ] Global Tenant Management APIs: Implement admin-only endpoints to manage tenants (organizations). For example: GET /api/admin/tenants – list all tenants with summary info, GET /api/admin/tenants/{id} – detailed info including perhaps usage stats, POST /api/admin/tenants/{id}/status – update tenant status (active/suspended) or other actions. These endpoints should only be accessible by Super Admins (use guard to enforce). Through these APIs, an admin can search tenants, see their metadata (name, created date, number of users, plan, etc.), and perform actions like deactivating a tenant (which could block login for users of that tenant, etc.).
•	[ ] Global User Management APIs: Similarly, create admin endpoints for user management across tenants. GET /api/admin/users – global user search (with filters by email, name, tenant, etc.), GET /api/admin/users/{id} – view a user’s profile along with which tenant(s) they belong to, POST /api/admin/users/{id}/actions – allow actions like disable user, reset password, or force email verification. These operations are sensitive: make sure to log them in audit logs. Also consider the effect of disabling a user – maybe set a suspended flag on the user that the auth system checks.
•	[ ] User Impersonation: Implement a secure mechanism for Super Admins to impersonate regular users. One approach: an admin calls POST /api/admin/impersonate with a target user ID (and perhaps tenant ID if user has multiple). The system verifies the admin’s privileges, then generates a special JWT for the target user (possibly with an embedded flag that it’s an impersonation). Return that token or a special impersonation link that the admin’s frontend can use to switch context. The admin can then perform actions as that user. Also implement POST /api/admin/impersonate/stop to end impersonation (basically revert to their admin identity, maybe by restoring the old JWT). Security: Log every impersonation event (who impersonated whom and when). Optionally implement the support PIN mechanism: if required, an admin must supply a one-time PIN that the target tenant admin generated. This means adding an API for tenant admins to generate a support PIN (store it hashed, short expiry) and the platform admin to use it to authorize impersonation of that tenant’s users. This is an extra layer – implement if specified.
•	[ ] Audit Logging: Build an Audit Log system accessible via the admin APIs. Design a simple Audit entity (timestamp, userId (who did action), action type, target (which could be a tenant, user, or other entity ID), description/detail). Ensure that throughout the app, important actions call an Audit service to record an entry (like user login, user created, password changed, role changed, data export, etc.). Provide GET /api/admin/audit endpoints to search and filter logs (e.g., by tenant, by user, by action type, date range). Because logs can be voluminous, consider pagination and sensible default ranges. Also ensure sensitive info in logs is handled (avoid logging passwords, tokens, etc., just log that an event happened).
•	[ ] System Health Monitoring: Provide an endpoint GET /api/admin/system-health that returns health info. This might include database connection status, Redis status, uptime, CPU/memory usage of the server (if accessible), and any background job queue backlogs. This could simply call NestJS health checks if using the Terminus module (which can check DB, Redis). Platform admins will use this to see if the system is operational.
•	[ ] Metrics & Analytics APIs: Implement endpoints for platform-level analytics. For example, GET /api/admin/metrics/usage – returns aggregate metrics like total number of tenants, total users, active users in last 24h, etc. GET /api/admin/metrics/revenue – returns financial metrics (MRR, ARR, total payments this month, churn rate). These would gather data from the database and Stripe (for revenue) or cached calculations. Possibly these metrics are precomputed periodically (like via a cron job that stores results in a table) to avoid heavy calculations on demand. Provide whatever granularity is necessary for the admin dashboard graphs (maybe daily data points for last N days for trends).
•	[ ] Data Management Tools: Provide admin APIs or scripts for data backup and migration. While actual backups might be done outside the app at the DB level, you could implement on-demand exports: e.g., POST /api/admin/tenants/{id}/export which triggers a job to collect all data related to that tenant (all their users, files, records) and bundle it (perhaps producing a .zip file). This is heavy, but useful for compliance (data portability requests) or migrating a tenant out. Also, if needed, endpoints to trigger a restore of a tenant from backup (though that might be extremely complex to do safely in a running system – might skip actual implementation and just note that backup is manual). Ensure such endpoints are highly restricted and logged.
•	[ ] Feature Flag Administration: If there are feature flags controlling premium features, provide an admin endpoint or extend tenant update to allow Super Admins to change feature flags for a tenant (e.g., turn on a beta feature for a specific tenant, or manually enable a feature as a promo). This ties into the earlier FeatureFlag system – basically an override UI for platform admin.
•	[ ] System Configuration Management: Implement a simple config store for any platform-wide settings that might be toggled at runtime. This could be a table of key-value pairs or just environment variables (for runtime toggles, DB is easier). Provide admin API to read/update these (for example, “disable user registrations” flag, or “system in maintenance mode” flag). If maintenance mode is set, the system might reject non-admin requests with a friendly message. Only Super Admins should be able to set these flags via an endpoint.
•	[ ] Alerts & Notifications for Admins: Integrate critical alerts to admin notifications. For example, if CPU usage is high or an error spike occurs, there could be an automated creation of an admin notification or even an email to platform admins. Some of this might be handled by external monitoring, but the app can also generate certain alerts (like “Tenant X had 5 failed payments” or “Background job failure rate high”). Ensure these are documented or surfaced in an admin “Alerts” view if not emailing.
•	[ ] Admin Authentication & Security: Consider requiring additional security for admin accounts. For example, enforce 2FA for any Super Admin user (you might set a policy that 2FA must be enabled to access admin routes). Possibly maintain an audit of admin logins separately. And ensure admin endpoints are protected by the highest-level guard (checking the Super Admin role/flag).
Frontend UI Tasks
•	[ ] Admin Dashboard Access: In the frontend, detect if the logged-in user is a platform Super Admin. If so, provide access to the Admin Panel section of the app. This might be a separate navigation item (e.g., “Platform Admin”) or even a separate app, but likely within the same Next.js app you can namespace it (for example, routes under /admin/*). Make sure normal users cannot even see these links or pages. If a non-admin manually navigates, the backend would deny and you can handle that (redirect away).
•	[ ] Tenant Management UI: Create an All Tenants page for Super Admins. This should list all tenant organizations in a table. Columns might include Tenant Name, Tenant ID, created date, plan, status (active/suspended), and maybe number of users. Implement search and filters (e.g., filter by plan or by status, search by name). Allow sorting by name or date. Each row can have actions or a link to a detail view.
•	[ ] Tenant Detail & Actions: Build a Tenant Detail page that shows comprehensive info about a specific organization. This includes: tenant profile (name, domain, branding info), plan and billing status (maybe pulling info from Stripe or internal records), usage statistics (from the analytics API, e.g., storage used, active users), list of users in that tenant (with roles). From this page, provide actions: Impersonate Tenant Admin (log in as an admin of that tenant), Suspend Tenant (toggle an active/suspended state – with confirmation), maybe Send Message (if you want to send an announcement to that tenant’s admin), or Delete Tenant (dangerous – probably only if needed for tests or cleaning up, with heavy confirmation flow). If custom domain management is needed, show that info and status (maybe allow admin to verify domain settings). Design this page to be a one-stop overview for support teams when a tenant has an issue.
•	[ ] User Management UI (Admin): Create an All Users page for Super Admins. This is a table of all users across all tenants. Columns: Name, Email, tenant(s) they belong to (maybe primary tenant), role (if a single primary role), last login, status. Include a search bar for email or name. Provide filter by status (active/suspended) or by tenant (perhaps a dropdown of tenants to filter users by a specific org). Clicking a user should go to a User Detail page.
•	[ ] User Detail & Actions: The Admin User Detail page should show the user’s profile info (name, email, etc.), their organization memberships (tenant names and roles in each), last login time, and any other relevant data (like whether 2FA is enabled, how many failed logins recently, etc., if tracked). Actions: Impersonate User (with possibly a tenant context selection if they have multiple), Suspend User (to deactivate their login – confirm action), Reset Password (maybe send a password reset email or force a reset), Remove from Tenant (if applicable to multi-tenant membership). Ensure UI confirms destructive actions and indicates success/failure. For impersonation, likely clicking it will obtain a token via API and then redirect the admin to the app as that user (maybe storing the original admin token to allow switching back). Provide a clear indicator during impersonation mode on the UI (like a colored banner “Impersonating John Doe (User ID 123) – click here to return to your admin account”).
•	[ ] Audit Log UI: Create an Audit Logs page for Super Admins. This page should allow searching and filtering through the audit log of events. Provide filters like date range, tenant, user, and action type (you can populate a dropdown of action categories like “Login”, “Impersonation”, “Data Export”, etc.). Display the results in a table with columns: timestamp, actor (who did it, and maybe their tenant), action description, target (if applicable). For example: “2025-09-26 10:45:23 – Alice (Tenant Acme Inc) – IMPERSONATION – Impersonated user Bob (Tenant Beta LLC)”. Provide pagination or infinite scroll for the log entries. This UI helps in forensics and support.
•	[ ] System Metrics Dashboard: Build a page or set of widgets for platform-level metrics. For example, an Analytics Dashboard showing: a chart of user signups over the last 30 days, a chart of active tenants over time, current total users, current total tenants, MRR (monthly recurring revenue) and other financial metrics, etc. This will use the metrics APIs to fetch data. Use a chart library (like Chart.js or Recharts) to plot trends (e.g., line chart for signups per day). Show key numbers in summary cards (e.g., “Total Users: 1234”, “Active Tenants: 56”, “Monthly Revenue: $X”). Ensure it auto-updates either on interval or when navigated to (fresh fetch).
•	[ ] System Health & Alerts UI: Provide an System Status page or section for monitoring. This might display info such as “API Server Status: Healthy (X ms response)”, “Database: Healthy (ping ok)”, “Redis: Healthy” – based on the health check API. Also display maybe current server load (if provided) and recent error rates (if you have those metrics – perhaps integrate with Sentry or logs, but at least a placeholder). If any alerts are active (like high error rate or manual maintenance mode), surface them here or as a banner. This page helps admins quickly assess system health.
•	[ ] Admin Config UI: If you implemented configurable settings, make a Settings page for platform configs. For example, toggles for “Allow New User Registrations” or “Enable Beta Features for All Tenants”, or fields for default limits etc. Only show settings that are safe to change on the fly. When admin changes a setting, call the API to update it and immediately reflect if it affects current behavior (some settings might require page reload or just affect new actions). Also show current system version or build (maybe from an env variable or package.json) for reference.
•	[ ] Support Tools: Provide small tools for support/admin convenience. For example: an interface to generate a one-time Support PIN (if the PIN system is used for impersonation authorization – though that’s likely on tenant side, not needed here except to input it if required), or a form to send a system-wide announcement (which could create a notification for all users or all tenant admins about something). Think of common support tasks and if any need UI: maybe “Search Logs” (less likely if logs not in DB), or “Re-send verification email to user” (could be on User Detail actions).
•	[ ] Impersonation UX: When an admin clicks impersonate and is switched into a user’s view, make it very clear. Possibly change the theme color or put a banner on top saying “Impersonating [User Name] – [Tenant Name]”. Provide a button to “Return to Admin” which will switch back (likely by restoring original token). Ensure that while impersonating, the admin cannot access the admin panel (unless you allow nested, but better to restrict – they should “stop impersonation” to get back to admin mode). This prevents confusion and also any accidental admin actions while in user mode.
•	[ ] Responsive Design: Though admins likely use these tools on desktop, ensure the admin pages are at least reasonably responsive or usable on various screen sizes. Tables can be made horizontal-scroll if needed on mobile. This isn’t top priority, but good to keep in mind.
•	[ ] Polish & Usability: Since the admin panel is for internal use, it doesn’t need to be fancy but should be functional and clear. Use consistent design with the main app but maybe a slightly different accent color to differentiate admin area. Provide confirmation modals for dangerous actions like deleting a tenant or user. If an action is performed, show a success message or toast for feedback. Make sure to handle loading states (e.g., while fetching tenant list, show a spinner or “Loading…”).
Testing & Documentation Tasks
•	[ ] Admin API Security Tests: Write tests to ensure that admin endpoints cannot be accessed by non-admins. For example, call an admin route (like GET /api/admin/tenants) with a normal user’s token and expect a 403 Forbidden. These are crucial to confirm security. Also test that an admin (Super Admin) token can access them and get expected data.
•	[ ] Impersonation Flow Tests: Develop tests for the impersonation logic. This could be partly unit (ensuring the service generates the correct token and audit log) and partly integration: use an admin account in a test, call impersonation API for a target user, then use the returned token to call some user-specific endpoint and verify it returns data as that user. Also test that ending impersonation or using the wrong token fails appropriately. If PIN is required, test the scenario of correct vs incorrect PIN usage (could be unit tests for the PIN verification logic). Ensure audit log entries are created for these events.
•	[ ] Audit Log Integrity Test: Populate some audit logs by performing actions in tests (e.g., create a user, change a role, etc., assuming those actions log audits). Then test the audit log retrieval API: filter by action, by user, etc., and verify the results match the events triggered. Also test that non-admins cannot query the audit log. If audit logs include sensitive info, verify that it’s appropriately stored (e.g., no plaintext passwords – which you wouldn’t anyway).
•	[ ] Tenant/User Management Tests: Use integration tests to simulate key admin operations. For instance: create a dummy tenant and user in a test, then use admin APIs to fetch that tenant, change its status to suspended, and verify that (perhaps by trying to log in as a user of that tenant and expecting failure). Or: use admin API to change a user’s role or suspend a user, then assert that user can’t log in or doesn’t have access after. These tests ensure the admin tools actually effect changes in the system.
•	[ ] Metrics Calculation Test: If you have metrics calculations (like MRR or active user count), write unit tests for those calculation functions. Provide sample data (e.g., 3 tenants with subscriptions, some canceled) and assert that MRR and churn are computed correctly. Also test edge cases like no data. This ensures the admin dashboard numbers are reliable.
•	[ ] Admin UI Tests: If possible, automate a few critical admin UI flows with an end-to-end test. For example, login as a Super Admin in Cypress, go to the All Tenants page, click on a specific tenant, suspend it via the UI, and then verify (perhaps via the UI or an API check) that the tenant is suspended. Another: use impersonation via the UI (click impersonate, ensure the UI switches mode and that making a user-level action works, then stop impersonation and verify return to admin mode). Some parts might be tricky to verify automatically (like visual indicators), but functional outcomes can be.
•	[ ] Load Test Consideration: The admin pages like audit logs and tenant lists could potentially be heavy (if there are thousands of tenants or log entries). While formal load testing might not be needed, consider doing a test with a large dataset in dev to ensure the UI and API can handle it (pagination helps). Document any limits (e.g., if there are 100k audit entries, the admin might need to filter by date to get results timely).
•	[ ] Documentation – Admin Guide: Prepare an Admin Guide document. This is a guide for internal administrators (or the dev team acting as admin) on how to use the Admin Panel and tools. It should cover: how to impersonate a user, how to handle common support tasks (resetting passwords, suspending a tenant, viewing logs), how to interpret the analytics dashboard, how to configure system settings, etc. Essentially, a mini-manual for the admin features so that a new team member or support engineer could perform these tasks confidently.
•	[ ] Developer Docs – Admin Module: In developer-focused docs, describe the structure of the admin module, and how it enforces security (mention the guard that restricts by Super Admin role). Also note any configurations like initial super admin user creation (perhaps the first registered user is auto-super-admin or there is a script to promote a user to admin). Document the impersonation approach (token swapping) for clarity.
•	[ ] Compliance & Auditing: In documentation, highlight that the system keeps audit logs of key actions and where those logs are (likely accessible via admin UI/API or directly in DB). This is important for any future compliance or security reviews. Also mention data retention policies if any (for audit logs, etc.). If your platform needs to comply with things like GDPR, note how an admin can fulfill data deletion requests (e.g., using the export and delete tools at tenant/user level).

## 12. 🔧 Developer Experience & Documentation

### **Backend API Tasks:**
•	[ ] OpenAPI/Swagger Integration: Set up Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation generation for the API. Use NestJS Swagger module to automatically generate API docs from decorators on controllers and DTOs. Go through all controllers and annotate them with @ApiTags, @ApiOperation, @ApiResponse, etc., to produce a comprehensive spec. Ensure all schemas (DTOs) are properly represented. The result should be accessible (in dev and maybe staging) at an endpoint like /api/docs.
•	[ ] OpenAPI Spec Verification: Validate that the generated OpenAPI spec is complete. Use a tool to check it or manually scan the Swagger UI to ensure all endpoints are documented. Pay attention to any errors or omissions (like missing models for complex types). This spec will be the basis for external integrations and possibly SDK generation, so it should be as accurate as possible.
•	[ ] Client SDK Generation (Optional): Use the OpenAPI spec to generate client SDKs for at least one language (TypeScript/JavaScript, since that might be used in a front-end, but our Next.js uses direct calls; this is more for external developer use). For example, use OpenAPI Generator or Swagger Codegen to produce a TypeScript API client. If feasible, include this generation step in the build or as a separate package (like a api-client package). If not implementing fully, at least verify that generation works and document the steps so developers can generate for other languages if needed.
•	[ ] Postman Collection: Maintain an up-to-date Postman collection (or Hoppscotch collection) covering all API endpoints. This may be partially generated from the OpenAPI spec or handcrafted for better examples. Ensure that any required auth is set via variables (like a placeholder token). Organize requests into folders by module (Auth, Tenants, Billing, etc.). Share this collection in the repo (e.g., in a postman/ directory) and mention it in docs.
•	[ ] GraphQL API (Optional): If providing a GraphQL API, set up a GraphQL module in parallel to REST. Define a GraphQL schema (perhaps mirroring key parts of the REST API) and resolvers. This is optional – if time permits, implement a simple GraphQL endpoint for a couple of core entities (like querying users or tenants) to demonstrate capability. If not implemented, ensure the system is structured to allow adding GraphQL later (i.e., not tightly coupled to REST specifics). Document whether this feature is enabled or not.
•	[ ] Docker & DevOps: Write Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations for all services for development and production. Ensure the backend (NestJS API) has a Dockerfile that builds a production image (with Nest build then Node runtime). The Next.js frontend too (if needed, though Next can be served via Node or static export). Update the docker-compose.yml for development: include services like Postgres (Supabase), Redis, etc., with proper environment configuration, so that a new developer can run docker-compose up and have a working stack. Provide a docker-compose.prod.yml (or Kubernetes manifests if targeting k8s) for production deployment references.
•	[ ] Environment & Config: Review and update all environment variable usage. Provide a clear .env.example file listing all required env vars for the app (DB URL, Stripe keys, email provider keys, etc. but with dummy/safe values) and instructions to obtain or set them. Make sure the config reading logic (perhaps using @nestjs/config or similar) covers all these and has reasonable defaults if possible. This will prevent deployment surprises and ease onboarding.
•	[ ] Seed Scripts: Implement a database seed script for development. For example, a NestJS command or simple Node script that creates a default tenant, an admin user, and perhaps some sample data (to see the UI populated). Document how to run it (maybe automatically run in Docker compose or via yarn run seed). This helps new developers and also in automated testing or preview deployments. Possibly include an option to create a test tenant with all features enabled for easy testing.
•	[ ] Logging & Debugging: Ensure the application has proper logging at various levels. For dev, set logger to debug/verbose to get detailed logs (SQL queries, etc. if needed). For production, set to warn/error to reduce noise. Integrate a structured logging library if needed (or Nest’s built-in is fine). Additionally, add a mechanism to easily toggle debug mode for certain modules (maybe via env var) to assist troubleshooting.
•	[ ] Error Handling & Messages: Go through the API and ensure consistent error responses. Document or standardize error format (e.g., { error: "Bad Request", message: "X is required", statusCode: 400 }). For developer experience, good error messages are key. Where possible, include enough detail (but not sensitive info) to help debugging (especially for validation errors, etc.). Possibly implement a global exception filter in Nest to format errors uniformly.
•	[ ] E2E Testing Setup: Configure an end-to-end testing capability. This could be done with a tool like Cypress for the web UI (which we mentioned) and something like Postman/Newman or a custom script for API E2E tests. Perhaps create a test:e2e script that boots up a test instance (maybe in memory DB or a Docker test DB) and runs a suite of requests to ensure the system works as a whole (covering registration to login to basic feature usage). This is a supplement to unit/integration tests and can catch misconfigurations.
•	[ ] CI/CD Pipeline: Set up continuous integration workflows (likely via GitHub Actions as noted) to run tests, linters, and build the app on each push. Ensure that the pipeline is defined in the repo (YAML files in .github/workflows). For deployment, if using an automated deploy (maybe to a service or just building Docker images), ensure that’s scripted as well. Document the CI/CD in the repo docs briefly so developers know how it’s structured.
•	[ ] Automated Code Quality: Integrate tools like ESLint (already configured), Prettier (for consistent formatting), and maybe TypeScript strict mode enforcement. The CI should fail if there are lint errors or formatting issues. Optionally integrate a security linter (like npm audit in CI or a tool like SonarCloud or Snyk for dependency checks). The idea is to catch issues early.
•	[ ] Developer Documentation: Ensure the /docs directory (or a GitBook, if using) contains all necessary documentation. This includes: setup guide (how to run dev environment, how to run tests), architecture overview (modules and flow, maybe a diagram of the system context), coding guidelines (if any conventions), and feature-specific guides (some of which we’ve noted writing in earlier tasks). Update the main README to provide a high-level introduction and link out to detailed docs. Make the README welcoming, with instructions to get started quickly (e.g., clone, run docker-compose, etc.) and a list of features.
•	[ ] API Usage Examples: In documentation, include example API calls for common use cases, maybe as part of an “API Guide”. For instance: how to authenticate and get a token, how to create a resource, etc., with example curl or HTTP requests. This complements the formal API reference (Swagger) with more narrative tutorials.
•	[ ] Storybook for UI: Set up Storybook for the component library (packages/ui). Ensure it includes at least a few components to show it’s working (buttons, form fields, etc.). This improves developer experience for UI devs, allowing them to build and test components in isolation. Also, if combined with design, it ensures consistency. Document how to run Storybook (yarn storybook or similar) in the README.
•	[ ] Developer Onboarding Check: Do a final run-through simulating a new developer machine setup: follow your own README to set up the project from scratch (new clone, install, env setup, run migrations, run seed, start dev servers). This will flush out any missing steps or configuration. If any issues arise, update the documentation or scripts to streamline the process. The goal is a new contributor can get the app running quickly (<30 minutes as per PRD success metrics).
Frontend UI Tasks
•	[ ] Hot Reload & Dev Build: Verify that Next.js is properly configured for fast refresh/hot reload during development. This is usually out-of-the-box, but ensure that shared packages (if using Yarn workspaces and a shared UI library) are also hot-reloaded when changed (may need next-transpile-modules or similar config). Document any steps if needed to get this working (like running Storybook concurrently can lock ports, etc.).
•	[ ] VSCode & Tooling Setup: Add recommended workspace settings or dotfiles for developers. For example, provide a .vscode/settings.json (if many use VSCode) with recommended extensions or project-specific tweaks (like formatting on save). Ensure Prettier and ESLint integrations are working in editors to catch issues early. Optionally, include an .editorconfig file to standardize basic formatting across editors.
•	[ ] UI Component Documentation: Using Storybook, document the core UI components. For each component, add stories that show different states (props, variations). This serves as live documentation. If Storybook is too much overhead, at least maintain a style guide MD file with screenshots of components. But Storybook is preferred as dynamic documentation.
•	[ ] Front-end Testing: Ensure React components have some tests (using React Testing Library). For critical components or utilities, write tests to validate that they render and behave correctly (e.g., a form component shows validation messages when invalid input provided). Also, set up an end-to-end test base using Cypress for key user flows (auth, basic feature usage). Document how to run these (like yarn test:cy).
•	[ ] Performance Budget: For front-end, consider performance best practices. Use Lighthouse or Web Vitals to test the app’s performance and identify any obvious slow points (maybe large bundle sizes). If something is heavy (like a big dependency for a small feature), consider code-splitting or using a lighter alternative. Ensure that you’re using Next.js dynamic imports for large modules (like if a rich text editor is used, load it only when needed). Not a strict task, but part of dev experience to deliver a snappy app.
•	[ ] Accessibility: Incorporate basic accessibility checks (maybe via Storybook a11y add-on or manual checks). Ensure that UI components have proper ARIA labels, forms have labels, color contrast is sufficient, etc. This might not be fully done, but set a foundation (like add eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y and fix obvious issues).
•	[ ] Internationalization (i18n) Setup: If using next-intl or similar as PRD suggested, ensure the framework is in place (even if only one language now). Provide an example of how to add translations for a component. This makes the project ready for multi-language support. If not implementing fully, at least keep strings in a constants file or use a translation function wrapper, so adding i18n later is straightforward.
•	[ ] Front-end Dev Notes: In documentation, add any front-end specific dev notes: like how state management is structured (Zustand or Redux usage guidelines), how styling is done (Tailwind usage conventions, if any custom styling approach needed beyond default), and how to work with the design system. Mention any known quirks (e.g., “we use React 18’s strict mode which calls effects twice, so be aware in development”).
•	[ ] Integration with Backend: Document how the front-end communicates with the backend (likely REST API calls via a wrapper in services/ or using React Query). Ensure that a new front-end dev knows where to add a new API call, how to handle authentication (e.g., token stored in cookies or context), and error handling patterns (like a centralized error toast or redirect to login on 401, etc.).
•	[ ] Production Build & Deployment: Test the production build process for the front-end. Run next build and next start to simulate a production environment. Ensure no errors and that environment variables (like API base URL) are correctly picked up. If deploying to something like Vercel, ensure configuration is set (maybe a vercel.json or specific env var naming). Document how to deploy the front-end (if separate from the backend). If using Docker for front-end, test that image. Essentially, verify that the front-end can be built and served in a production scenario outside dev.
Testing & Documentation Tasks
•	[ ] Testing Framework Implementation: Ensure that both backend and frontend have their testing frameworks configured and running in CI. For backend, Jest should be set up with ts-jest and a test environment that can hook into a test database (you might use an SQLite memory DB for unit tests, or a test Postgres container for integration tests). Verify that a simple test (like always true) runs. For frontend, ensure jest or react-scripts test is configured for components (including any needed transforms for JSX, CSS, etc.). Write a couple of sample tests to ensure everything is wired (like a trivial component test and an API service test mocking fetch).
•	[ ] Coverage Reports: Configure code coverage collection in tests and output a summary. In Jest, enable coverage and maybe add --coverage in the test script. Ensure that the results are output (and possibly uploaded in CI to a coverage service, or at least fail if below threshold). The PRD suggests aiming for >85% coverage. Set a threshold in package.json or CI config to enforce this (if currently not at 85%, work towards it or set a slightly lower temporary threshold to not block pipeline but keep it visible).
•	[ ] Continuous Integration Pipeline: Double-check that the CI pipeline (GitHub Actions or others) runs all necessary steps: install deps, lint, test (unit + integration), build, etc., and reports status. If any step is flaky, address it. Ensure that secrets (for CI, if needed for integration tests to access a test DB or Stripe test keys) are handled securely via CI secret store. Test the pipeline with a dry run (or a real run on a branch) to confirm everything passes. Document in the repo’s Contributing or README any CI requirements (like naming conventions if using Conventional Commits, which they set up Husky for possibly).
•	[ ] Deployment Pipeline: If a CD pipeline is set up (to push to a staging or production environment), verify it. This might involve checking Docker image builds, pushing to a registry, etc. Document how deployment works (e.g., “commits to main branch auto-deploy to staging” or “we use manual GitHub Actions workflow to deploy to prod”). Ensure env vars in production are properly configured (perhaps provide a sample .env.production with needed keys, but not actual secrets).
•	[ ] Monitoring & Logging in Prod: Confirm that production will have monitoring. For example, if using a service like Papertrail or DataDog for logs, ensure the app can send logs (maybe through a Winston transport). If using something like Prometheus for metrics, ensure the endpoint is set (maybe /metrics if using Prom client). This might not be fully testable without the infra, but document the expectations (like “We use ELK stack for logs, make sure to set env var X to the log endpoint…”). Also ensure crash scenarios are handled (use a process manager or restart policy in Docker). Document any known performance tuning or scaling approach (like “set up multiple API instances behind a load balancer for X tenants”).
•	[ ] Security Audit & Checklist: Do a final pass for security issues. Some suggestions: ensure all user inputs are validated (especially any file uploads or HTML inputs, to avoid injection or XSS in front-end if displaying). Verify that sensitive data (passwords, tokens) are never logged or exposed. Check dependency vulnerabilities (run npm audit and update any critical ones if possible). Possibly run a simple vulnerability scan or use tools like OWASP ZAP in a test environment to catch obvious web app issues. Document that these checks were done and if any remaining items are accepted (maybe note them in a SECURITY.md).
•	[ ] Performance Testing (Optional): If time permits, do a light performance test of key endpoints (like login or an often-called API) with a tool like Artillery or JMeter. The goal is to see if it meets the performance targets (e.g., <200ms for 95th percentile as in PRD). This might be heavy to automate fully, but can be done on a staging environment. Document results or any tuning applied (like increased DB pool or added caching for specific queries). If caching with Redis was planned (e.g., for expensive list queries), ensure a basic implementation is in place and tested (perhaps a simple cache layer on a frequently used service method).
•	[ ] Documentation Review: Go through all documentation (README, /docs markdown files, code comments, etc.) and ensure they are up-to-date with the current state of the project (since during development things evolve). Remove any outdated references (e.g., if earlier plan was to use TypeORM but switched to Prisma, ensure docs reflect Prisma usage). Also ensure the Product Requirements (the PRD itself) is marked as fulfilled or note any deviations. It's good to write a short summary in the docs of what is not implemented or left as future work, so stakeholders know the status.
•	[ ] Developer Handover Document: Compose a brief “handover” or summary document for the project. This can be part of README or separate. It should outline the overall architecture (maybe with a diagram showing NestJS API, Next.js web, Expo mobile (not implemented now but maybe later), plus external services like Stripe, Redis, etc.), and highlight key decisions (like “Using Supabase (Postgres) with Prisma, multi-tenant single-db approach with row-level security, etc.”). This is basically an overview that helps someone quickly understand the system without reading the entire PRD. It can reference the PRD for detail, but encapsulate the big picture.
•	[ ] Final QA: Before declaring the checklist complete, do a final quality assurance run: create a fresh user, go through all main user flows (sign up, email verify, create data, invite user, change plan, upload file, send message, etc.) to ensure everything works together in the deployed environment. Note any bugs or UX issues encountered and create tasks/bugs for them (or fix immediately if minor). The checklist should ideally end with all critical issues resolved or tracked. Document any known issues that are minor or out-of-scope as “Known Issues” in the docs so they’re not forgotten.
